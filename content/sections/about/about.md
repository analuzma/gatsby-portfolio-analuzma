<b>Generalist in anything digital 👩‍💻</b><br><br>
I studied Marketing and Communications and always thought I would end up working in a creative ad agency. But in my last semester I discovered <b>how with a bit of Tech and lots of Googling</b>, I could turn peoples <b>dreams and businesses into a reality.</b><br><br>
For next 3 years I became a <b>self-taught remote WordPress freelancer</b>, offering websites and digital services to help people with their online presence. Doing SEO, eCommerces, blogs, mailing, etc. but I knew I could be doing more.<br><br>
